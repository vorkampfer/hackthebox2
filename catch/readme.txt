# HTB Catch
# Linux
# Difficulty: Medium

### Synopsis:
Catch requires finding an API token in an Android application, and using that to leak credentials from a chat server. Those credentials provide access to multiple CVEs in a Cachet instance, providing several different paths to a shell. The intended and most interesting is to inject into a configuration file, setting my host as the redis server, and storing a malicious serialized PHP object in that server to get execution. To escalate to root, Iâ€™ll abuse a command injection vulnerability in a Bash script that is checking APK files by giving an application a malicious name field. ~0xdf
